##### 2025 Update
_Almost a decade later and I still like what I made. It's simple and it works. Not revolutionary, but it helped me learn._

# I made my own flexbox framework

<p>Building it helped me learn flexbox and css in general, and that's really what the main purpose is. It's just to help me learn and to make each website a little easier to build than the one before. It's not meant to be perfect or better than any other framework.</p>
<p>I use this framework for the front-end development work of landing pages made specifically for Google ads we make for various customers. So far it's worked out great, speeding up my workflow and allowing me to finish 3x as many pages in the same amount of time.</p>
<p>This framework is not finished, but view the documentation here: <a href="https://c-uliano.github.io/alce">c-uliano.github.io/alce</a></p>
<p><b>Side Note:</b> I have the files for a lightbox but I just haven't set it up in the html yet. This is part of the whole not-being-finished-yet thing I mentioned above.</p>
