# I made my own flexbox framework

<p>Building it helped me learn flexbox and css in general, and that's really what the main purpose is. It's just to help me learn and to make each website a little easier to build than the one before. It's not meant to be perfect or better than any other framework.</p>
<p>I use this framework for the front-end development work of landing pages made specifically for Google ads we make for various customers. So far it's worked out great, speeding up my workflow and allowing me to finish 3 times as many pages in the same amount of time.</p>
<p>This framework is not finished, which you will notice if you go to <a href="https://c-uliano.github.io/alce">c-uliano.github.io/alce</a></p>
<p><b>Side Note:</b> I have the files for a lightbox but I just haven't set it up in the html yet. This is part of the whole not-being-finished-yet thing I mentioned above.</p>
<p>Also, I want to intergrate normalize into this framework, that's something I need to start working on</p>
